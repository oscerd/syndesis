= Add a step to describe data

In an integration, some connections do not declare data types. 
To be able to map data fields from or to connections that do not
declare data types, {prodname} provides the *Describe Data* 
step, which lets you specify a schema for the
current integration data. For example, in an
integration, you 
might need to add a *Describe Data* step 

* Between an API connection and a data mapping step.
* Between an AMQ connection and a data mapping step.

To add a step that specifies a data schema, start to create your 
integration. Add the connections to the applications you want to 
integrate, then:

. In the left pane, between the connections that require specification
of a data schema, hover over the plus sign and in the popup, click
*Add a Step*. 
. On the *Add a Step* page, click *Describe Data*. 
. To configure the *Describe Data* step:
+
.. Select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* JSON schema
* JSON instance document
* XML schema
* XML instance document

.. To import the schema, choose a file or specify a URL for the schema. 
If you are using a JSON file, the file extension must be `.json`.
If you are using an XML schema, the file extension must be `.xsd`.
If you are using an XML document, the file extension must be `.xml`. 

.. If you are importing a schema, identify the root element. 
+
{prodname} immediately tries to upload the specified file or obtain the 
schema from the URL. If there is an error, {prodname} displays a 
message about the problem. Correct the error and try again. 

. When {prodname} has a valid schema, click *Done*.
