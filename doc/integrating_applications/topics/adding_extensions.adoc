= Adding extensions

{prodname} provides a number of bulit-in steps for operating on 
integration data. If {prodname} does not provide a step that you need,
a developer can code an extension that defines one or more
custom steps. The developer gives you a `.jar` file that contains the extension.
You then upload the extension in {prodname} to make the custom step(s)
available for use in integrations. The following topics provide details:

* <<making-extensions-available>> 
* <<managing-extensions>>

Information about coding the extension and creating the `.jar` file are
in the 10.2 _JBoss Fuse Tooling Guide_. Link TBA.
