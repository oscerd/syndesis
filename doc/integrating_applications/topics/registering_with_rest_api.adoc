= Register {prodname} as an API client

Before {prodname} creates an API client
connector, it prompts you to indicate the API's security requirements.
For APIs that use OAuth, when {prodname} creates the connector it also 
adds an entry for the API to the {prodname} *Settings* page. This is
where you provide the API client ID and the API client secret that
authorize {prodname} to access the API. 

If the API you want to connect to does not use OAuth, skip this 
section and see <<create-rest-api-connection>>.  

To register {prodname} as an authorized API client:

. Prepare the {prodname} callback URL that the API will use:
.. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Home*.
.. Copy the {prodname} URL from the browser address bar and paste it in 
a text file. 
.. In the text file, remove `dashboard` from the end of the URL.
.. Append `api/v1/credentials/callback`. For example, your callback URL
might look like this:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Settings*. 
. Look for the name of the API you want to connect to and click its 
*Register* button to display its client ID and client secret fields. 

. In another browser window, you must register {prodname} as an OAuth
client of the API you want to connect to. The exact steps for doing this
vary for each API service. Typically, the API service provides an OAuth
custom application setting page. Go to that page. 

. On that page, 
provide the {prodname} callback URL and obtain the API service's
client ID and client secret that {prodname} will use to access the API.  
. Paste the client ID and the client secret into their
respective fields in the {prodname} *Settings* page. 
. Click *Save*.
