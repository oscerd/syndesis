## syndesis minishift

With `syndesis minishift` you can adequately manage a https://www.openshift.org/minishift/[minishift] installation for hosting Syndesis.
This command is especially useful for a simple and self-contained development workflow.

`syndesis minishift` requires that you have a current minishift in your path.
You can download it directly from https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases[GitHub].

----
Usage: syndesis minishift [... options ...]

Options for minishift:
    --install                 Install templates to a running Minishift.
-p  --project                 Install into this project. Delete this project if
    --reset                   Reset the minishift installation by
                              'minishift delete && minishift start'.
    --full-reset              Full reset by
                              'minishift stop && rm -rf ~/.minishift && minishift start'
    --memory <mem>            How much memory to use when doing a reset. Default: 4GB
    --cpus <nr cpus>          How many CPUs to use when doing a reset. Default: 2
    --disk-size <size>        How many disk space to use when doing a reset. Default: 20GB
    --show-logs               Show minishift logs during startup
    --openshift-version <ver> Set OpenShift version to use when reseting (default: v3.6.0)
                              already existing for --install.
                              Default project: "syndesis"
-i  --image-mode <mode>       Which templates to install: "docker" for plain images,
                              "openshift" for image streams (default: "openshift")
-o  --open                    Open Syndesis in the browser

### Installing Syndesis

You can easily install Syndesis with the option `--install`.
This option triggers the creation of all relevant OpenShift resources objects in the currently connected OpenShift project.

If you want to use a different project, then use `--project` (short: `-p`) to specify this project.

WARNING: Any existing project will be deleted first when specified with `--project`. This option is also an easy and quick way to recreate a Syndesis installation.

As explained in <<syndesis-dev-modes,Development Modes>> there are two workflows for developing Syndesis:
Either with plain Docker images and killing pods (`--image-mode docker`) or with OpenShift S2I builds and image streams (`--image-mode openshift`).
You have to specify the mode already when installing Syndesis as this choice also determines the OpenShift templates to use.
By default the `openshift` mode is selected, so you have to specify `--image-mode docker` only when using the plain Docker image mode.

### Resetting Minishift

The quickest way to get a fresh Syndesis setup is to use `--project` which will install Syndesis into a clean, new project.

However, you can also recreate the whole Minishift installation with `--reset`. This will delete the Minishift VM (`minishift delete`) and create a new one (`minishift start`).
It doesn't harm if the Minishift VM does not exist so that you can use `--reset` also on a fresh Minishift installation.

If you want to get a real clean installation use `--full-reset` which deletes the `~/.minishift` directory which holds downloaded artefacts like the ISO image for the Minishift VM.
Using `--full-reset` forces Minishift to re-download all those files.

There are several options which influence the re-creation of the VM:

[cols="5,10,2",options="header"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|`--memory`
| Memory to use for the Minishift VM.
| 4 GB

|`--cpus`
| Number of CPUs used for the Minishift VM.
| 2

|`--disk-size`
| Disk space used for Minishift.
| 20 GB

|`--show-logs`
| Whether to show OpenShift logs during startup.
| false

|`--openshift-version`
| OpenShift version to use
| 3.6.0
|===

### Example

This short example performs the following actions:

* Stops and deletes a running Minishift VM (if existent)
* Removes `~/.minishift` (if existent)
* Install Syndesis in OpenShift modes (S2I builds & image streams) in project `syndesis`
* Open Syndesis UI in the default browser

```
# Complete fresh installation in project "syndesis"
syndesis minishift --full-reset --install --project syndesis

# Open Syndesis in default browser
syndesis minishift -o
```
