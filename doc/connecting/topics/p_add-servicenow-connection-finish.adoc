= Copying records to ServiceNow during or to finish an integration

You can copy records to ServiceNow in the middle of a flow 
or to finish a simple integration. 
To do this, add a ServiceNow connection to the middle of a flow 
or as a simple integration's finish connection. 

.Prerequisites

* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you
to choose a step. Or, {prodname} is prompting you to choose a finish connection. 
* You know the name of the ServiceNow import set that you want to 
add records to. Your ServiceNow administrator can
help you identify the appropriate import set. If the import set 
does not exist, see 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#create-servicenow-import-set_servicenow[Creating an import set in ServiceNow].
* The ServiceNow import set is configured to handle the addition 
of records.

.Procedure

. Click the ServiceNow connection that you
want to add to the integration. 

. Click the *Add Record* action. 
. Click in the *Import Set* field and select the import set that
you want to add records to. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Results
* {prodname} adds the connection to the flow. 
* Typically, a data mapper step is needed before this connection.
In the integration visualization panel, 
{prodname} displays 
image:shared/images/WarningIcon.png[Data Type Mismatch] on the
connection. In most integrations, you need to map a source field 
to the target field used as the correlation field in the 
ServiceNow table.
